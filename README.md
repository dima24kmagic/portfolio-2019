# The portfolio backbone was written in 2019 with plain React

    It would be nice to move it to the SSR, but as a software engineer
    I'm not trying to overcomplicate tasks if there's no need for that
    I asked myself why do I want to transfer this to SSR and clean up the code?
    Since I'm gon send this to recruiters by myself I don't need much of SEO optimization + it's just regular React app which gon load up relatively quickly
